# SimpleCOVID19Simulator
Run the `sim_current.py` file    
A very simple agent-based SIR model of COVID-19 spread in a locality.   
The people in this 100mx100m locality go out to shop for milk and then go for work.
During daytime, a street vendor goes randomly to each house selling vegetables.  

The time period of remaining infected is modelled by a Gamma(mean=6.4,std=2.3) distribution.
